## Smart Reader for the Blind Using Raspberry Pi 3B+

This project aims to create a Smart Reader for the Blind using a Raspberry Pi 3B+. The Smart Reader captures images, processes them to extract text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and converts the text to speech, providing an audible output for visually impaired users.

### Project Overview

The Smart Reader leverages the power of computer vision and text-to-speech synthesis to assist visually impaired individuals in reading printed text. It captures images via a camera, processes the images to enhance readability, extracts text using OCR, and then converts the text to speech. The system also includes buttons to capture images and play/pause audio output.

### Components Needed

1. **Raspberry Pi 3B+**: The main processing unit.
2. **Camera Module**: To capture images. (Raspberry Pi Camera Module or USB Camera)
3. **Push Buttons**: For capturing images and controlling audio output (e.g., play/pause).
4. **Resistors**: 10k ohms for pull-up/down configuration of buttons.
5. **Jumper Wires**: For making connections.
6. **Breadboard**: For assembling the circuit.
7. **Power Supply**: For powering the Raspberry Pi.
8. **Speakers/Headphones**: For audio output.
9. **SD Card**: With Raspbian OS installed.
10. **Python Libraries**: OpenCV, pytesseract, RPi.GPIO, and Festival (for text-to-speech).

### Circuit Diagram and Connections

1. **Camera Module**: Connect the camera module to the CSI port on the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Capture Button**:
    - Connect one terminal of the button to GPIO pin 5.
    - Connect the other terminal to GND.
    - Use a pull-up resistor (10k ohms) between GPIO pin 5 and 3.3V to ensure a stable input state.
3. **Play/Pause Button**:
    - Connect one terminal of the button to GPIO pin 6.
    - Connect the other terminal to GND.
    - Use a pull-up resistor (10k ohms) between GPIO pin 6 and 3.3V to ensure a stable input state.
4. **Speakers/Headphones**: Connect to the audio jack of the Raspberry Pi.

### Code Explanation

The provided code initializes the camera, sets up GPIO pins for the buttons, and defines functions to capture images, play/pause audio, process images for OCR, and convert text to speech.

1. **Button Setup**: Configures GPIO pins for input with pull-up resistors and attaches interrupt callbacks for button presses.
2. **Capture Image**: Captures an image when the capture button is pressed, saves it, and calls the `process_image` function.
3. **Play/Pause Audio**: Toggles the audio output using a system command.
4. **Process Image**: Enhances the captured image by converting it to grayscale, applying histogram equalization, and blurring for better OCR performance.
5. **OCR and Text-to-Speech**: Reads the captured image, extracts text using `pytesseract`, and converts the text to speech using the Festival TTS engine.

### Additional Features and Improvements

1. **Edge Detection**: Apply edge detection algorithms (like Canny) to improve text extraction accuracy.
2. **Automatic Language Detection**: Implement automatic detection of the text language and switch TTS language accordingly.
3. **Real-Time Feedback**: Add a small display to provide real-time feedback on the captured image and recognized text.
4. **Enhanced Audio Quality**: Use a better TTS engine like Google Text-to-Speech or AWS Polly for improved audio quality.
5. **Multi-Language Support**: Include support for multiple languages in OCR and TTS.
6. **Wireless Connectivity**: Add Bluetooth support for wireless headphones or speakers.
7. **Mobile Integration**: Develop a companion mobile app to control the device remotely and receive text notifications.
8. **Power Management**: Implement power management to prolong battery life for portable use.

### Conclusion

This Smart Reader for the Blind project provides an accessible solution for visually impaired individuals to read printed text. By combining image processing, OCR, and TTS, the system offers a comprehensive and user-friendly experience. With additional features and improvements, the project can be made even more efficient and versatile, providing greater assistance to those in need.
